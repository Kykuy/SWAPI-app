### General description/usage guide

_____

The data is split into 6 main categories, with every entry of SWAPI present(200+ data entries).

Selecting a category will bring every entry of that category to view, separated by pages. From then, you can type something into the search field and press "Start search" button to narrow down the output, or switch to another category. Press "Cancel search" to view the whole subset of entries for the data category again after initiating search.

Clicking on an entry will open a new block displaying full info about the entry.
